# NostrSharp

NostrSharp is a Nostr client coming soon to a C# near you.
 
## What is NostrSharp?
* NostrSharp is going to be a Nostr client written entirely in C#, using Microsoft's .NET Core platform.
* It will be cross-platform, and will be able to run on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android, with possible web support later on.
* The desktop portion will be completed first.
* The user interface will be built with [AvaloniaUI](https://www.avaloniaui.net/), a cross-platform UI framework.
* It will be released under the MIT licence, and will be free to use for any purpose.

## Philosophy

NostrSharp is opinionated. It prefers performance to features, transparency to magic,
and errs on the side of providing options to users in the faith that they know how to
tailor their experience to their tastes better than I do.

Initially, we are working on basic functionality, such as getting the feed working,
managing relays and credentials, and posting messages

## Contributing

NostrSharp is open source, and contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute, please hit me up on Nostr.

I am not a designer, so if you are, please help me out with the UI.
